    "p2": "My mother is from Spain and my father from Puerto Rico. I grew up bilingual, living between two worlds. That dual perspective shapes everything I do - I see problems from multiple angles and build bridges between different communities, stakeholders, and ways of thinking.",
    "p3": "My journey in education started at Liberty Science Center in New Jersey, where I fell in love with the moment when a student's eyes light up understanding something new. From there, I moved through museum education, afterschool STEM programs, and eventually into K-12 schools.",
    "p4": "When New York City launched CS4All - the nation's most ambitious computer science equity initiative - I helped lead the work in Manhattan. Over three years, I watched teachers who'd never coded before become confident CS educators. I saw students from underrepresented communities discover talents they didn't know they had. That experience taught me that access isn't enough - you need systems, support, and a commitment to equity.",
    "p5": "Since then, I've worked at national scale leading CSforALL's SCRIPT initiative, designed coaching frameworks at Cornell Tech, and now serve as a Research Scholar at NC State's Friday Institute, managing SceneCraft - an AI-enhanced educational tool. In this role, I align research, design, and stakeholder collaboration to create data-informed learning solutions that respond to the evolving needs of students and educators. Each position has reinforced my belief that innovation spreads not through technology alone, but through relationships, trust, and translating between the languages of different stakeholder groups.",
    "p6": "Currently based in Durham, NC, I'm working at the intersection of AI and education while always looking to explore beyond the horizon. Throughout my career, I've built bridges: between researchers and practitioners, between policy makers and teachers, between US and international education systems, between corporate partners and school districts. I believe that quality of life matters, that community matters, and that you can do meaningful work from anywhere.",
    "p7": "I bring a strategic, community-driven approach to all aspects of my work, grounded in a commitment to educational equity, empathetic leadership, and the responsible integration of emerging technologies. Whether helping EdTech companies navigate new markets and partnerships, supporting schools in implementing innovative tools responsibly, or building coalitions that bridge different stakeholder ecosystems, I focus on creating sustainable, systemic change.",
    "p8": "I believe deeply that every student deserves access to powerful learning experiences, regardless of their background. That belief - alongside a focus on data-informed decision making and culturally responsive practices - has guided every program I've built and every partnership I've formed.",
